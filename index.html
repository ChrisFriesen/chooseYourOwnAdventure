        <h1>Summertime <i>in</i> Quarantine</h1>
        <p>It may not really feel like it but summer has come to the UK and to Edinburgh. From what I can tell this means an assortment of sunny and foggy days that have equal amounts of people relaxing in the Meadows. While the cafes are not yet open to enjoy there is a distinctive lack of tourists to overcrowd your favourite city spots! On your way back from The Emerald Isle you will find a more friendly city than what you left though don't get too excited, Nicola Sturgeon is adamant that we exercise caution.</p>
        <p>With the Scottish rules not yet lifting do you:</p>
        <p><a href="1-1.html">[ Break quarantine to boulder with the best of them ]</a></p>
        <p><a href="1-4.html">[ Crack open the new economics text you've been waiting on ]</a></p>
