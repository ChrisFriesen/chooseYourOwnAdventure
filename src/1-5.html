        <h1>Don't JUDGE on APPEARANCE</h1>
        <p>You cautiously enter her house and diligently attempt to solve a tangled mess of cords that look as though they've been macramed together by the cat. While you don't make a lot of headway the lady seems happy for the company and starts to tell rather shocking stories of her younger days in the London party scene. You come back later that week and end up having to go with her to purchase new window coverings after they fall apart under your ministrations. She's rather surprised by your appearance and when questioned she mumbles something about punk rock and spandex pants with dinosaurs. In gratitude she gives you a painting of a psychedelic unicorn, to go with your former outfit.</p>
