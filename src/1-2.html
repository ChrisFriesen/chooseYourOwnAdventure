        <h1><i>Don't JUDGE on APPEARANCE</i></h1>
        <p>The woman suddenly appears friendly as she asks, "Are you talking about the Dev Degree with Shopify?!". Turns out she's in your cohort and is coming straight from a degree in astrobiology. </p>
        <p>"You mean, studying aliens?" you ask. "Yeah, turns out there's not a lot of work in it."</p>
        <p>However, you learn that her hoodie was torn up by her puppy last night which turns out to be the cutest samoyed you've ever seen. You spend the rest of the day hanging out with the two of them and talking about all the cool apps you'll build in the future.</p>
        <p>As ideas go you decide you'll build:</p>
        <p><a href="1-10.html">[<i> a website that sells bespoke pet furniture </i>]</a></p>
        <p><a href="1-5.html">[<i> an app that pings anytime there is a dog nearby</i>]</a></p>
