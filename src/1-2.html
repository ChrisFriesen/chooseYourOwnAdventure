        <h1><i>Blind Encounters</i></h1>
        <p>The hummus is amazing and you now have created a wishlist of various carabiners on your phone. All and all a successful outing especially after you navigated that difficult buttress! Afterwards you are just walking up to your flat in your climbing gear only to pass by an old lady perched on the steps leading up to her home. </p>
        <p><b>"You, young man! Are you any good with blinds?"</b></p>
        <p>Startled you stop and reply:</p>
        <p><a href="1-5.html">[ "Yes actually, I just fixed my own up recently" ]</a></p>
        <p><a href="1-10.html">[ "Everyone's are different, you should probably call a professional" ]</a></p>
