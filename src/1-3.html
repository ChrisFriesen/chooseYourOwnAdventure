        <h1>You make your way down to the shore line and only see a gaggle of swimming Canadian Geese. Closing your eyes and breathing in the fresh air a sense of peace settles on you... at least until there's a tugging at your pant leg and you look down to see yourself surrounded by geese! They have misidentified you as food and start pecking, honking and chasing you until you find yourself running all the way back to your car. </h1>
